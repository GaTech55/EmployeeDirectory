## Description

The purpose of this app was to create an Employee Directory. The Employee Directory allows a user to view the entire employee directory at once so that they have quick access to their information. A manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about their employees. Currently functionality to filter and sort is only provided on the First Name column.

## Acceptance-Criteria

```md
Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.

The user should be able to:

- Sort the table by at least one category

- Filter the users by at least one property.
```
